Welcome! Thanks for volunteering to test my game. It's a text-based game.

--What do I need to do?
Just play the game like you usually play games but I want you to pay attention to any errors.
Send me any errors you notice, you can also send screenshots or videos.

The primary things I want you to test in the game:

- Conditions (Example: If user has at least 3 meat in inventory, he can eat. Else, he cannot) MAKE SURE THE CONDITIONS WORK.
- Crafting items and getting supplies (Check your inventory from time to time to see if you are actually getting items)
- Limitation of amount of items in your inventory (Get as many items as possible (more than 30) and there should be 30 of them)
- Make sure the limitation of health and hunger values work. If user gets them higher than 100, they will go back to 100.

You need to test the game for at least 25 minutes.
After you are done testing the game, also send me what you suggest for the game.


--What do I need?
You need an IDE. I suggest Visual Studio Code. You will run the game in Visual Studio Code, so you could see errors and info about them.
